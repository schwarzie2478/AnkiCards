## What's the Markdown?
%
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax.
Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats,
but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.



## {{c1::John Gruber}} created the Markdown language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax.
